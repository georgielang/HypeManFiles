The use of this application requires the accumulation of some information from your user and guild. 
The adding of this application to your server and subsequent use of this application is an agreement to this.

Access Of Data

The data stored in this application is only accessible to the sole developer. 
The information stored will never be sold, or shared to any extent.
The only use of this information is for the development and testing of this application.

Data Stored

This application stores a very limited amount of data and only stores what is required for base functions.
It stores:

- When a guild has the application (Bot) added to the server, the application holds the guilds ID.
- When a user has an "intro" set, it stores the user's ID

Storage of Data

The service used to host this application is the same in use to store the data. 
This provider has built- in protection to stop any third party access to any information.
Although there is protection there is no guarantee that there won't be a data breach and 
application developers hold no responsibility for any breaches in security.
If a data breach happens, all users will be informed ASAP.

Manual Removal of Data

At any time, any user or owner of a guild has a right to join contact the 
developer of the application to have the date removed, however this will cease functions for that guild.
To reach the owner, there is a dedicated server that you can join to get in contact with the Devs.

Automatic Removal of Data

As for the application removing data, when the user uses a command to get rid of their "intro", the file will be immediately removed with the user's id.
Also if this application is removed from a server, the server and all user ID's stored in the servers dedicated files will be removed immediately.
